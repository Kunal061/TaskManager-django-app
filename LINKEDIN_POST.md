## 🚀 Full Post

🎉 **Excited to share my latest project: Django Task Manager deployed on AWS EC2!**

I just built and deployed a full-stack web application using modern DevOps practices with the help of Qoder AI - and I want to share the journey! 💡

**🔧 What I Built:**
A production-ready Django Task Manager application with complete CRUD functionality, containerized and deployed on AWS EC2.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Django 4.2.7 + Python 3.11
- **Database:** SQLite (initially PostgreSQL, pivoted for simplicity)
- **Server:** Gunicorn with 3 workers
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5.3.2 + Custom CSS
- **DevOps:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Cloud:** AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
- **Static Files:** WhiteNoise

**⚡ Key Highlights:**

✅ **Containerized Architecture** - Dockerized the entire application for consistent deployments across environments

✅ **Production-Ready Setup** - Configured Gunicorn WSGI server, static file handling, and security best practices

✅ **Cloud Deployment** - Successfully deployed on AWS EC2 with proper security group configuration

✅ **Automated Deployment** - Created deployment scripts for one-command deployment

✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Generated complete guides covering setup, deployment, and troubleshooting

**🐛 Challenges Faced & Solved:**

1️⃣ **Docker Daemon Issues** - Resolved permission and service configuration on EC2
2️⃣ **Dockerfile Package Conflicts** - Fixed Debian vs Alpine package incompatibilities
3️⃣ **PostgreSQL Authentication** - Troubleshot Docker volume persistence issues
4️⃣ **Database Strategy Pivot** - Switched from PostgreSQL to SQLite for streamlined deployment
5️⃣ **Migration Failures** - Debugged and resolved database migration issues

**💡 What I Learned:**

🔹 Leveraging AI tools like Qoder to accelerate development while understanding every component
🔹 Real-world Docker troubleshooting and container orchestration
🔹 AWS EC2 deployment best practices and security configurations
🔹 The importance of comprehensive documentation for maintainability
🔹 When to pivot technical decisions (PostgreSQL → SQLite) for project requirements

**🎯 Results:**

✔️ Fully functional task management system
✔️ Accessible at http://13.233.122.241:9000
✔️ One-command deployment capability
✔️ Complete documentation for future maintenance

This project reinforced my passion for DevOps and cloud engineering. It's not just about writing code - it's about building robust, deployable, and maintainable systems! 🌟

## 🎨 Technical Deep-Dive Version (For Tech Audience)

**🔥 From Code to Cloud: Django Task Manager Deployment Journey**

Just wrapped up an interesting DevOps project - building and deploying a Django app on AWS EC2 with Docker. Here's the technical breakdown:

**Architecture:**
```
Client → AWS EC2:9000 → Gunicorn (3 workers) → Django 4.2.7 → SQLite
         └─ Docker Container (Python 3.11-slim)
         └─ WhiteNoise (Static Files)
```

**Tech Decisions:**

🐳 **Containerization Strategy**
- Multi-stage Docker build with python:3.11-slim-bullseye
- Volume mounting for persistent SQLite database
- Gunicorn configured with 3 workers for optimal performance

☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure**
- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
- Security Group: Custom TCP rule on port 9000
- Elastic IP: 13.233.122.241

**📊 Interesting Problems Solved:**

1. **Docker Volume Persistence Bug**
   - PostgreSQL credentials cached in Docker volumes
   - `docker-compose down -v` wasn't clearing properly
   - Solution: Pivoted to SQLite, eliminating multi-container complexity

2. **Debian Package Resolution**
   - Initial Dockerfile used `musl-dev` (Alpine-specific)
   - Debian-based image required `libpq-dev` + `build-essential`
   - Added `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` for clean builds

3. **Migration Automation**
   - Created idempotent deployment script
   - Integrated wait logic for container readiness
   - Automated static file collection and migration execution

**Performance Metrics:**
- Cold start: ~10 seconds
- Container size: ~450MB
- Deploy time: <2 minutes (full rebuild)
- Update time: <10 seconds (code-only changes)

**Deployment Automation:**
```bash
./deploy-sqlite.sh  # One command deployment
```

Built with assistance from Qoder AI - excellent for rapid prototyping while maintaining code quality and understanding.
